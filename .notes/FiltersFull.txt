client\src\app\(nondashboard)\search\FiltersFull.tsx


**** the full basic code
 

** first we import some important thing 


** creating the main function, const FiltersFull

** const dispatch = useDispatch();

** const router = useRouter();

** const pathname = usePathname();

** const isFiltersFullOpen = useAppSelector((state) => state.global.isFiltersFullOpen);
        * Understanding  State vs Actions

        this is the same way we used Selector for viewMode & for filters but here function are diffrent in client\src\state\index.ts

        ** updatedSearchParams
        ** the loop 
        ** the loop part 2
        ** cleanFilters 
        ** backend connection with the url
        ** backend connection with the url part 2
