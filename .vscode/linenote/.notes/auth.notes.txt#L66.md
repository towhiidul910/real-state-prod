1. Fetches the auth session.
Code:


const session = await fetchAuthSession();
Explanation:

This line calls the fetchAuthSession function to retrieve the authentication session (which may contain authentication tokens like idToken).
This function would usually fetch the session from local storage, cookies, or by making an API call to an authentication service (like AWS Cognito, Firebase, etc.). This will provide the necessary info to authenticate the user.
