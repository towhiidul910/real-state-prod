Good question! Let me break it down with an example.  

### **What Happens Without `debounce`?**
Let’s say the user is typing in a search bar that updates the `location` filter.  
- They type: `"New York"`  
- This means `handleFilterChange()` is triggered **every time** a letter is typed:  
  ```
  N → Ne → New → New  → New Y → New Yo → New Yor → New York
  ```
- If **debounce wasn’t used**, `updateURL()` would run **instantly** on every keystroke.  
- This would spam the URL like:  
  ```
  /search?location=N
  /search?location=Ne
  /search?location=New
  /search?location=NewY
  /search?location=NewYo
  /search?location=NewYor
  /search?location=NewYork
  ```
- That’s **7 updates to the URL in less than a second!** 😨

---
### **What `debounce` Does**
- **Delays execution** of `updateURL()` until **after** the user stops typing for a short time (e.g., 300ms).  
- If the user keeps typing **within** the debounce delay, it cancels the previous updates and waits again.  
- Instead of updating the URL 7 times, it updates **only once** after the user finishes typing:  
  ```
  /search?location=NewYork
  ```
- This **reduces unnecessary re-renders & router updates** → making the app **faster and smoother.**  

---
### **Analogy**
Imagine you have an **annoying friend** who texts you after **every** word they type instead of waiting to finish the sentence:  

❌ **Without debounce:**  
> Friend: "Hey"  
> Friend: "Hey, how"  
> Friend: "Hey, how are"  
> Friend: "Hey, how are you?"  

✅ **With debounce (normal person behavior):**  
> Friend: "Hey, how are you?"  

Debounce makes sure your app acts like a **normal person** instead of that spammy friend. 😂

---
### **How to Set a Debounce Delay?**
By default, your code is missing a **debounce delay**, so it might not be working properly.  
Use:
```tsx
const updateURL = debounce((newFilters: FiltersState) => {
  // Same function logic here
}, 300); // 300ms delay
```
This ensures it **only updates the URL if no new changes happen for 300ms** after the last user input.

---
### **Final Thought?**
- Debounce is **critical** for performance when handling **user input + state updates**.  
- Without it, your app can lag, spam the URL, and **re-render too often**.  

🔥 Let me know if this makes sense or if I should break it down even more! 🚀


click vs real time updates url 
if your app's filters are only applied when the user clicks a "Search" or "Apply Filters" button. In that case, you wouldn't even need debounce because the function only runs once when the button is clicked.

However, here's why your current approach doesn't use a button and instead updates the URL in real-time:

### **What Happens If You Don't Use `cleanParams`?**  

If you remove `cleanParams` from your `updateURL` function, **your URL might get messy with unnecessary or empty query parameters**. Let's break it down.  

---

### **What `cleanParams` Does:**  
```ts
export function cleanParams(params: Record<string, any>): Record<string, any> {
  return Object.fromEntries(
    Object.entries(params).filter(
      ([_, value]) =>  // Ignore the key since we're only filtering values
        value !== undefined &&
        value !== "any" &&
        value !== "" &&
        (Array.isArray(value) ? value.some((v) => v !== null) : value !== null)
    )
  );
}
```
It **removes unwanted values** from `params`, specifically:  
✅ `undefined`  
✅ `"any"` (a placeholder value)  
✅ `""` (empty strings)  
✅ `null` (unless inside an array that contains other values)  

---

### **What Can Go Wrong Without `cleanParams`?**
#### **1️⃣ Unnecessary Query Parameters**
Without `cleanParams`, filters with empty values will still be added to the URL.  
Example:  
```ts
filters = { location: "", priceRange: [null, null], bedrooms: "any" };
```
URL Output Without `cleanParams`:
```
/search?location=&priceRange=null,null&bedrooms=any
```
🔴 **Problem:** The URL has junk values like `""`, `"null,null"`, and `"any"`, making it ugly and harder to read.  

---
#### **2️⃣ Potential Issues When Restoring State from URL**
- If `""` or `"any"` is stored in the URL, your app might mistakenly **restore these values as valid filters** when reloading the page.  
- Example:  
  ```ts
  const searchParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
  filters.location = searchParams.get("location"); // Might return an empty string
  ```
  🔴 **Problem:** Your filters might break because they expect `null` instead of `""`.  

---
#### **3️⃣ Performance Issues (Unlikely but Possible)**
- If you have lots of unnecessary parameters, your URLs get **longer** and could slow down sharing or indexing.  
- Too many useless params might even **affect caching** in some cases.  

---

### **Should You Remove `cleanParams`?**
❌ **Bad Idea** — You’ll end up with a cluttered URL and potentially incorrect filter behavior.  
✅ **Keep It!** — It makes sure only meaningful filters appear in the URL.  

### **If You Must Remove It...**
If you *really* want to remove `cleanParams`, at least modify `updateURL` to **manually filter out junk values** before setting them in `URLSearchParams`.
