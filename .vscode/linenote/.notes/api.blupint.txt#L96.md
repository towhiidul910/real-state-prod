Ah, the classic confusion between **PUT**, **PATCH**, and **DELETE**. It’s one of those things that seems straightforward until you get into the actual usage. Let me break it down for you, and I’ll even throw in a visual to make it stick!

### **PUT** vs **PATCH** vs **DELETE**: Here’s the breakdown

#### **PUT**
- **Full replacement**: You use **PUT** to replace the entire resource with new data. It’s like rewriting the whole book when you update just one chapter. If you provide a partial resource (e.g., just one field), it still replaces the entire resource with the one you send.
- **Idempotent**: It means calling **PUT** multiple times with the same data will not change the result. It’s like hitting the *Save* button multiple times—nothing changes after the first click.
  
  **Example**: If you're updating a user's profile, and you use **PUT** to update just their email, it will completely replace their entire profile with the new data.

#### **PATCH**
- **Partial update**: **PATCH** is used when you want to update part of the resource, not replace it entirely. It's like editing a paragraph in a book, instead of rewriting the whole book.
- **Not always idempotent**: The result may differ if you run **PATCH** multiple times with different data. It’s more flexible for partial updates.

  **Example**: Updating a single field, like changing just the email or phone number of a user. You're only updating part of the resource.

#### **DELETE**
- **Remove resource**: **DELETE** is used when you want to completely remove a resource. Once the resource is deleted, it’s gone. You can’t use **DELETE** to "update" anything; its purpose is to destroy a resource.

  **Example**: Deleting a user from the database, or removing a property from the user's favorites.

### Visualizing the Difference

Let’s say we have a **User** object with the following fields:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "johndoe@example.com",
  "age": 30,
  "address": "1234 Main St"
}
```

#### **PUT** - Replace Entire Resource
You use **PUT** when you want to replace the whole user object:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@newemail.com",
  "age": 35,
  "address": "5678 New St"
}
```

The **PUT** request would replace the **entire** object, even if you only changed one field.

#### **PATCH** - Partial Update
You use **PATCH** when you only want to update part of the resource, say, just the **age**:

```json
{
  "age": 35
}
```

The **PATCH** request updates only the **age** field, keeping the rest of the user object the same. You don’t have to send the entire object.

#### **DELETE** - Remove Resource
A **DELETE** request would remove the user entirely. There’s no data sent with a DELETE—just the identifier of what you want to remove. The **User** object would be gone after this call.

### In a Diagram:

```
[User Object]
| id | name   | email               | age | address       |
|----|--------|---------------------|-----|---------------|
| 1  | John   | johndoe@example.com  | 30  | 1234 Main St  |

----------------------------------------------
PUT Request: Replace the entire object
----------------------------------------------
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@newemail.com",
  "age": 35,
  "address": "5678 New St"
}

----------------------------------------------
PATCH Request: Update part of the object (e.g., age)
----------------------------------------------
{
  "age": 35
}

----------------------------------------------
DELETE Request: Remove the object (completely gone)
----------------------------------------------
```

### Why You Used **PUT** More
- You might have been using **PUT** out of habit or because you're more familiar with it as a **“full replacement”** method.
- **PATCH** is more for **partial updates**, so it feels a little more specific. It’s probably not as intuitive at first, especially if you’re doing "big" updates where you're replacing whole records.
- **DELETE** is obviously for when you want to remove a resource altogether.

### Recap:
- **PUT**: Replaces the entire resource.
- **PATCH**: Partially updates a resource.
- **DELETE**: Removes the resource.

Now that you’ve got a solid grasp of the differences, you’ll know which to use depending on the situation! Let me know if any of this is still hazy or if you need more examples.
