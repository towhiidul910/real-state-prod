You're on the right track! Let's break down your thought process and clarify what's going on when you use **PATCH** to toggle the `fev` field between `true` and `false`.

### The Problem with Using **PATCH** to Toggle `fev` Between True and False

When you use **PATCH** to update the `fev` field (e.g., changing `true` to `false` and back to `true`), you are **partially updating** the object. The issue here is that the `fev` field is just a single part of the object, and toggling it could get a bit tricky depending on how the object is structured and how you intend to manage that state.

#### Example:
Let’s say you have an object like this:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "John",
  "fev": true
}
```

Now, you want to toggle the `fev` field using **PATCH** requests:

1. **PATCH (True → False)**:

   ```json
   {
     "fev": false
   }
   ```

   This request would update the `fev` field to `false`, but it would leave the rest of the object unchanged.

2. **PATCH (False → True)**:

   ```json
   {
     "fev": true
   }
   ```

   This would toggle the `fev` field back to `true`.

### Potential Issues:
1. **If the field doesn’t exist**: If the `fev` field doesn’t exist in the object, you might run into issues where you’re trying to toggle something that isn’t there. In this case, if you use **PATCH** to set `fev` to `true`, and the field doesn’t exist yet, it’ll **create** the `fev` field. But if you expect it to be toggled, and it's not initialized properly, it could cause unexpected behavior.
   
2. **Inconsistent state**: If you're toggling between `true` and `false` using **PATCH** (like toggling the `fev` status on or off), the state might get inconsistent if there’s any race condition or failure in updating the field. For instance, if you’re trying to toggle it back to `true` after setting it to `false`, and there’s some error or failure in the process, you might end up with incorrect data.

### What Happens If You Delete `fev`?
If you want to completely remove the `fev` field (say because you no longer care about it), using **DELETE** would make more sense in that scenario. If you remove the `fev` field completely, you wouldn’t need to toggle it—just **DELETE** it from the object and the field will no longer exist. 

If the field doesn't exist, your **PATCH** will be a bit cleaner because you're not worried about toggling it back and forth; you simply update or remove it as needed.

### Using **PATCH** vs **DELETE** in This Context:
- **PATCH**: When you use **PATCH** on the `fev` field, you're making partial updates. This is fine for toggling between `true` and `false`, but **make sure the field exists** and is always properly updated to prevent inconsistent states.
- **DELETE**: If you want to remove the `fev` field completely (i.e., stop using it altogether), then **DELETE** is more appropriate because it removes the field from the object entirely.

### What Happens if You Use **PUSH** for `fev`?
If you're using **push** (for example, to add the `fev` field to an array of `favorites` or similar), you'd need to ensure that you're working with the correct data type and structure. **Pushing** values (e.g., adding `fev: true`) into an array or object is fine, but **removal** (e.g., toggling `fev: false`) would mean you'd need to **manage that state carefully** to avoid issues where you might unintentionally **add** and **remove** values at the wrong time.

### So, What’s the Best Approach?
- If **`fev`** is just a flag (like a boolean that marks whether something is favorited or not), **PATCH** works fine to toggle it between `true` and `false`. Just make sure you're handling its existence properly (i.e., checking if it's there before trying to toggle).
- If **`fev`** is meant to be **removed completely** from the object (like you don't want to track whether it's favorited at all anymore), then using **DELETE** would be the better choice. You don't need to worry about toggling anymore because it's gone.
- **PUSH** is better suited for **adding new items** to a list or array, not for toggling or updating a single field. If you’re toggling between `true` and `false`, you're not "adding" something, you're **updating** it, so **PATCH** is more fitting.

### Conclusion:
- **PATCH**: Use for partial updates, like changing `fev` from `true` to `false` or vice versa. But handle the existence of the `fev` field carefully.
- **DELETE**: Use if you don’t want the `fev` field at all anymore. This will remove it entirely from the object.
- **PUSH**: Not suitable for toggling a flag. It's for adding values to lists or arrays.
