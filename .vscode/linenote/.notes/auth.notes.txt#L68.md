The `fetchAuthSession` function returns an **`AuthSession`** object, which contains more than just the `idToken`. The `AuthSession` typically includes various pieces of information about the user's authentication state, credentials, and tokens. Here's what the `AuthSession` object generally contains:

### Typical contents of the `AuthSession` object:

1. **`idToken`** (String):
   - The **ID Token** represents the identity of the user and is usually JWT (JSON Web Token) format. It contains claims such as the userâ€™s identity, roles, permissions, and any custom attributes you may have added.
   - It is used to authenticate the user when making requests to APIs.

2. **`accessToken`** (String):
   - The **Access Token** is used to authenticate requests to AWS services and APIs.
   - It typically has a shorter expiration time than the ID Token and is used to access specific protected resources on behalf of the authenticated user.

3. **`refreshToken`** (String):
   - The **Refresh Token** is used to obtain new **Access Tokens** and **ID Tokens** when they expire. It can be used to get new tokens without needing to re-authenticate the user.

4. **`credentials`** (Object):
   - This contains AWS credentials (if you're using AWS Cognito or other AWS services), such as **`accessKeyId`**, **`secretAccessKey`**, and **`sessionToken`**.
   - These credentials are used for authenticating and authorizing API calls to AWS services.

5. **`user`** (Object):
   - This contains user information (like the user ID, email, and custom attributes) that you might need in your app. The `user` object is typically populated with details such as the user's name, email, and custom attributes (e.g., role, group).
   - Example: The user object could contain:
     - `username`
     - `email`
     - `sub` (user's unique identifier)
     - `cognito:roles` (roles assigned to the user)

6. **`expiresAt`** (Timestamp):
   - This is the timestamp for when the session (specifically the tokens) will expire. It's important for handling token refresh logic in your app.
   - You can use this to check if the token is still valid or if it needs to be refreshed.

### How do you access them?
Here is an example of how you might use the returned session object:

```typescript
import { Auth } from 'aws-amplify';

async function getAuthSession() {
  try {
    const session = await Auth.currentSession();
    const idToken = session.getIdToken().getJwtToken(); // idToken
    const accessToken = session.getAccessToken().getJwtToken(); // accessToken
    const refreshToken = session.getRefreshToken().getToken(); // refreshToken

    const user = session.getUser(); // Get the user info (like username, email)
    const credentials = await Auth.currentCredentials(); // AWS credentials (if needed)

    console.log("ID Token:", idToken);
    console.log("Access Token:", accessToken);
    console.log("Refresh Token:", refreshToken);
    console.log("User Info:", user);
    console.log("AWS Credentials:", credentials);
    
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching auth session:", error);
  }
}
```

### Summary of the contents:
- **ID Token**: Information about the user (e.g., their identity, claims).
- **Access Token**: Token used for API access (typically short-lived).
- **Refresh Token**: Token used to refresh expired access tokens.
- **Credentials**: AWS access key and secret key for interacting with AWS services.
- **User Info**: User-specific data (like username, email, etc.).
- **Expiration Info**: When the session will expire.

So, **`fetchAuthSession`** provides you with everything you need to authenticate the user, manage their session, and interact with AWS resources (if you're using AWS services).
