What is fetchWithBQ?
fetchWithBQ is a helper function provided by RTK Query's Base Query. It allows you to make API requests manually within queryFn.

Normally, RTK Query automatically handles fetching when using query.
With queryFn, you need to manually fetch data using fetchWithBQ.



🧐my explanation

we need this for some important reasons

we want to see if the data in the current user endpoint exists or not or if it gives any errors or not

if the fetchWithBQ(endpoint) current endpoint , for current user which we detact with const user = await getCurrentUser();
this 
it exists or not
if the fetchWithBQ(endpoint) current user gives any errors or dont exiest or returns 404 then we create new user createNewUserInDatabase


keep in mind we storing the fetchWithBQ in userDetailsResponse , while we create new user in database we storing it in the same userDetailsResponse


in userDetailsResponse aka fetchWithBQ or aka new created user in database contain various details 
like user, idToken, userRole, fetchWithBQ etc we want to access some of the data in our layout or in other file aka pages thats why we return some data 
 return {
            data: {
              cognitoInfo: { ...user },
              userInfo: userDetailsResponse.data as Tenant | Manager,
              userRole,
            },


🧐 if we want to grab some data we can do that like 
const {data: authUser} = useGetAuthUserQuery()
  console.log("authUser", authUser)


  🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥gpt version of my explanation 

  Your explanation is solid! You're correctly breaking down the logic behind `fetchWithBQ` and why it's needed. However, I’ll refine it a bit for clarity and flow while keeping your style intact. Here's a cleaned-up version with better structure:

### **Why Do We Need This?**
We need this logic for some important reasons:  

1️⃣ **Check if the user exists**  
- We use `fetchWithBQ(endpoint)` to fetch the current user’s data based on their `userId`.  
- We determine the user with `const user = await getCurrentUser();`.  
- If the endpoint returns valid user data, great! We store it.  

2️⃣ **Handle missing users (404 error case)**  
- If `fetchWithBQ(endpoint)` returns an error (like 404), it means the user doesn’t exist.  
- In that case, we create a new user in the database using `createNewUserInDatabase()`.  

3️⃣ **Store the fetched/created user data**  
- We store the result of `fetchWithBQ` inside `userDetailsResponse`.  
- If a new user is created, we also store that result in `userDetailsResponse`.  

### **Why Do We Return Data?**
- `userDetailsResponse` (whether fetched or newly created) contains important details:  
  - `user` → The user object  
  - `idToken` → Authentication token  
  - `userRole` → Whether the user is a `manager` or `tenant`  
- We return this data so we can access it in other parts of our app, like layouts or pages.  

### **How Do We Access This Data?**
If we want to grab this data in our components, we can do:  
```tsx
const { data: authUser } = useGetAuthUserQuery();
console.log("authUser", authUser);
```
This lets us use the fetched user info anywhere in the app.

### **🧐 Verdict on Your Explanation**
✅ **Good:** You covered all the key points.  
✅ **Logical Flow:** You explained step-by-step why we fetch, handle errors, and store the data.  
🔹 **Improvements:** 
- **Use better structure.** (Breaking it down into sections makes it more readable.)  
- **Clarify variable names.** (`userDetailsResponse` holds either fetched or newly created user data.)  
- **Refine grammar a bit.** (Your explanation makes sense but could be smoother.)  

Overall, **you got the concept right**, just needs a bit of polish for clarity. 🔥 Keep it up! 🚀
