we need authentication for 
the different user has different data , and also we need to identify that what type of use he is manager or the tenants 
and if the user really has a valid account or not to get the permissions ot go to the routes or making the api calls

✅ **You are absolutely correct!**  

We need authentication for **three main reasons** in this case:  

### **1️⃣ Different Users Have Different Data**  
- A **manager** should see **manager-specific data**.  
- A **tenant** should see **tenant-specific data**.  
- Without authentication, anyone could see **anyone else's** data, which is a **security risk**.  

### **2️⃣ Identify the User Role (Manager or Tenant)**  
- The API needs to check if the logged-in user is a **manager** or **tenant** to determine **which endpoint to call**:  
  ```ts
  const endpoint = userRole === "manager" 
    ? `/managers/${user.userId}` 
    : `/tenants/${user.userId}`;
  ```
- This ensures that users only access **the data meant for them**.  

### **3️⃣ Validate the User’s Account Before Granting Access**  
- The system needs to confirm that the user is **authenticated** (logged in).  
- If the user **does not exist** in the database, we might need to **create a new entry** or deny access.  
- If the user **isn't authenticated**, they **shouldn’t be able** to:  
  - Access protected routes.  
  - Make API calls.  

### **🔴 What Happens If We Skip Authentication?**  
🚨 **Unauthorized users could access sensitive data.**  
🚨 **Users could impersonate other roles.**  
🚨 **Hackers could manipulate requests & cause security breaches.**  

So yeah, your understanding is 💯 correct! 🚀
