when we create vpc it automaticlly create a main route table, `we dont want to use that ` **we want to use different rout tables for each subnets**

`First`

create 1st **Route Tables**

click **Create route table**

Name - optional: re_public-route-table-1, click **Create route table**

select our vpc

click action , select **Edit Subnet associations**

select **public subnet-1** click **save**

`Again` 

create 2nd **Route Tables**

click **Create route table**

Name - optional: re_private-route-table-1, click **Create route table**

select our vpc

click action , select **Edit Subnet associations**

select **private subnet-1** click **save**


`Again` 

create 3rd **Route Tables**

click **Create route table**

Name - optional: re_private-route-table-2, click **Create route table**


select our vpc

click action , select **Edit Subnet associations**

select **private subnet-1** click **save**










## another edit for re_private-route-table because it still not connected to the internet 
 click **re_private-route-table-1**
click **Edit routes**

click **Add route**

it should be **Route 2**
click  **Destination** select **0.0.0.0/0**
Target select **internet Gateway**
and select down blow select the internet gateway that we created

click **Save changes**

`this will allow public access`
`private route table will not have internet access thats why we didn't create  internet access`

## 🗺️ What Is a Route Table (in AWS VPC)?

A **Route Table** in AWS is like Google Maps for your VPC.

It tells your traffic:
- “Go this way to reach the internet.”
- “Use this road to reach another subnet.”
- “Take this back alley to hit a NAT Gateway.”

Basically, every **subnet** in your VPC must be associated with **one** route table.  
This table defines **how traffic flows in and out** of that subnet.

---

## 🧱 Default vs Custom Route Tables

### 📦 Default Route Table
- Created automatically with the VPC
- Initially has a route for **local traffic** only (like roommates texting inside the same apartment)

### 🛠 Custom Route Table
- You create this to add internet access, NAT gateways, peering, etc.
- You attach specific subnets to it

## 🤔 Why Use Different Route Tables for Different Subnets?

Let’s imagine you're setting up a war camp. You don’t want the enemy to waltz into your strategy tent, right?

Here’s why we split ‘em:

| Subnet Type | Route Table | Why? |
|-------------|-------------|------|
| **Public Subnet** | Has a route to the **Internet Gateway (IGW)** | So EC2 instances can be reached by the internet |
| **Private Subnet** | Has a route to a **NAT Gateway**, but NOT IGW | So they can **initiate** internet requests (like `npm install`) but **not be reached** from outside |
| **Isolated Subnet** | Local routes only, no internet/NAT/IGW | Ideal for sensitive stuff like databases |

---

## ⚔️ Example:

You’re building a full-stack web app:

- **Frontend EC2 / Amplify / Load Balancer** — lives in a **Public Subnet** (needs IGW)
- **Backend EC2 / Lambda / Express.js server** — lives in a **Private Subnet** (needs NAT)
- **Database (RDS)** — lives in an **Isolated Subnet** (no external access)

Each of those gets its **own route table** to control the flow:
- Public gets: `0.0.0.0/0 → Internet Gateway`
- Private gets: `0.0.0.0/0 → NAT Gateway`
- Isolated gets: no 0.0.0.0/0 route

---

## TL;DR 🎯

**Route Tables = Traffic Controllers for Subnets**

- Want **internet access**? → Add IGW in route table
- Want **outbound-only access**? → Add NAT Gateway
- Want **super secure, no internet**? → Keep only local route
- Use **different route tables** when different subnets need different access levels

---

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

- You *can* reuse one route table across multiple subnets, but it limits control.
- When debugging “Why can’t my EC2 connect to the internet?”, check route tables first.
- Naming route tables like `rtb-public`, `rtb-private` saves lives (and sanity).
